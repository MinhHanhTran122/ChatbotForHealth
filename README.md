1. Rule-based Chatbot : A rule-based chatbot uses a simple rule-based mapping or pattern matching to select responses
   from sets of predefined responses.
3. Retrieval-based Chatbots: A retrieval-based chatbot uses Machine Learning ensembles as heuristics for evaluation.
4. Generative-based Chatbots: Generative models do not rely on predefined responses. They come up with new replies from scratch.
   Machine Translation techniques are typically used in generative models, but instead of translating from one language to another,
   we "translate" from input to output (response).
